ðŸ‘¾ Heyo, if you wanna get some idea about my work on GitHub, here's a small range of things:
- Some fun PRs from my open-source work at MongoDB:
    - **TypeScript:** [Revamping the Flipper debugger](https://github.com/realm/realm-flipper-plugin/pull/123).
    - **Go:** [Switching to server-side transpilation on the CLI client](https://github.com/10gen/realm-cli/pull/178).
    - **.NET/C#**: [Removing backing fields when weaving classes](https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet/pull/3088).
    - **Kotlin:** [Adding Decimal128 support](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/pull/1179).
    - **Lua & C:** [Creating an experimental SDK](https://github.com/realm/realm-lua-bootcamp/pull/14)
- My work at the student developer club I founded while at Princeton, [Hoagie.io](https://hoagie.io), working to create an ecosystem of campus applications. I led the efforts to design, develop and deploy 2 widely popular web apps:
    - [Hoagie Stuff](https://github.com/HoagieClub/stuff), a campus bulletin board with weekly digest emails, regularly used by hundreds for their lost and found items, clothing sales, and more.
    - [Hoagie Mail](https://github.com/HoagieClub/mail), which is used by campus organizations, academic departments, and more to send communications to the entire undergraduate population, having sent more than 44,000 mass emails and counting. 
    - **Hoagie API**, a centralized REST API for campus data and powering all of our apps using Go, MongoDB, and Auth0. Currently closed-source.

While you are at it, you can also check out my website at [gagik.co](https://gagik.co/) where some things may be more visual and its (rather outdated) [source code](https://github.com/gagik/gagik.github.io).
